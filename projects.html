                            <strong>Matchismo</strong><br><br>
                            This is a iOS app with two different card games in it.<br>
                            One of them in a card matching game, the user can flip the cards and tries to match them the best they can.<br>
                            The other game is called Set. The user needs to match cards by sets, depending on the shape, color, filling, and number of the card.<br>
                            I wrote this project entirely, so I had to handle not only the user interface, but also all the gameplay logic. I also created custom views to make the cards look good.

                            I really enjoy playing Hearthstone. In this game, you create your own deck, and you play against other people. If you win your rank gets better, otherwise, it gets worst. I have noticed that the popular decks are not always the same. So I thought about an app that keep track of which deck you encounter at which rank. So the user can have an idea of what the opponent's deck is likely to have. <br>
                            Also, my app tells the user which deck they should use at a certain rank, based on their win/loss ratio against the most popular decks.

                            <strong>StoreWithMe</strong><br><br>
                            During CalHacks 2014, my team and I came up with a fancy project. As students, it is sometimes a struggle to find a storage unit over the summer, most of the time, we have to rent a gigantic place for more than the period that we need. So we thought of a equivalent of Craigslist, but for storage units only. So if someone has an extra closet, or an attic that they are not using, they can post an offer on our <a href="http://www.plshire.me/storewithme/" target="_blank">site</a>.<br>
                            I mainly worked on the iOS part of our project, I implemented features such as geolocalization, dropbox and other, to make an easy to use application.

                            <strong>Winplateforme</strong><br><br>
                            Winplateforme is pretty much Facebook, but for French pharmacists. However, it goes beyond its social aspect. Winplateforme helps pharmacists manage their team, buy products, assign tasks. I work on two main parts of this web application. 
                            First, I created a page where the user can see the website's statistics. To do so, I gathered the data, and grouped it in an intelligent manner. Finally, I used JQPlot to display the data.<br> 
                            I also worked on the implementation of hashtags in the system. I used string recognition methods to detect hashtags, and then I generated useful metadata about those tags. For instance, who wrote it, in which post, when. Finally, I created a page where the user can see the most popular hashtags, and how often they were used month by month.
