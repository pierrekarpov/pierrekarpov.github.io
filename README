The brand I am trying to communicate is competency, reliability, and eccentricity. 
My high value customers are potential employer who seek someone motivated, and fun to work with. I show that I am worth something by having an elegant website, with nice interaction (such as the fade on mouseover)
I have put all my styles in a css file, which is not what everyone would do. It would have been better if I had use more classes instead of ids.
